# National Parks

National Parks demo app. A Java web app binding to a MongoDB instance.

## Workflow

After the Habitat operator is up and running, execute the following command from the root of this repository:

```
kubectl create -f examples/national_parks/habitat.yml
```

This will deploy two `Habitat`s, the national parks Java app and a MongoDB instance.
